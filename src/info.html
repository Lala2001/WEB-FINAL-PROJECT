                    Ludo originated from the Indian game Pachisi, as do other cross and circle games. The game and its variants are well-liked worldwide and go by many different names.
                    During the sixth century, Pachisi was invented in India. The ancient Ellora caves provide evidence that the strategic game originated in India. Shakuni's use of 
                    cursed dice to defeat the Pandavas and lose everything gave the game new significance.
                    In ancient times, the game was also referred to as Chaupar. Many former emperors played the contemporary version of Pacheesi, and the Mughal emperor Akbar is a notable example.
                    The board game has developed beyond Indian history, from "royal ludo" to becoming popular all over the world.
                    The original ludo board was converted to a cubic die with a dice cup and coined <q>Ludo</q> in England. The British Royal Navy adopted it and changed Ludo into the board game Uckers.
                    Moreover, Alfred Collier obtained a patent for the current version of Ludo in England in 1896. The only significant difference between the rules is that the rectangular dice is replaced with a cubic one.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            To begin the game, each participant must select a corner of the board as their assigned area. 
                            First, the player rolls the dice and only moves one piece. Players choose a token and advance 
                            it around the board based on the number that appears on the die.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a player rolls a six, he or she gets an extra or "bonus" roll in that turn if they are unable 
                            to draw a token from home. The player makes a bonus roll if the bonus roll results in a six once 
                            more. When the third throw also results in a six, the turn instantly shifts to the following player.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a player's token ends on a square that is occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is sent 
                            back to its home. When that player rolls a 6, the returned token can then reenter the game. 
                            Opponent cannot enter the player's home column.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The player must enter the home after a rotation and roll the exact number to enter each piece in the home.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Other Important things to know:</b><br><br>
                    Players have the option of entering one piece or all four tokens and until then, all of the tokens must stay in the square. 
                    The players move their tokens into their designated starting squares when it is their turn, then go clockwise around the 
                    track until they reach home. Therfore, the objective is to compete with one another to get to the home square first. 
                    Die rolls determine how quickly a player's pieces go to his or her home square, and the strategy game also demands that 
                    the player prevent other coloured tokens from getting home first. The game is won by the first person to bring in all of 
                    the tokens, while other players continue to compete for second, third, and fourth place.
